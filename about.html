        <h2>Welcome to PCGameHub</h2>
        <p>Welcome to PCGameHub, a website dedicated to games and programming! Here you will find two exciting games
            that will challenge your brain and provide you with hours of entertainment.</p>
        <h2>Hackmypc</h2>
        <p>Hackmypc is a game where you
            have to guess a number between one and one hundred to hack a computer. The more guesses you use, the lower
            your score will be. This game is perfect for those who like to solve puzzles and challenge themselves.</p>
        <h2>ProgProQuiz</h2>
        <p>ProgProQuiz is a game that tests your knowledge of programming, especially HTML and CSS. Here you will be
            challenged with simple questions about coding and see how much you know about this exciting field.</p>
        <p>In the future, we will add more games and programming projects, so stay updated on our website to see what's
            coming!</p>
        <h2>Guess the Color Code: Boost Your Programming Skills!</h2>
        <p>Guess the Color Code is not just a fun gameâ€”it's also a sneaky way to become a coding wizard! As you decode
            the secret color numbers, you're actually practicing the kind of coding used in programming. Each color has
            its own special code, like #FF0000 for red. So, while you're having a blast with colors, you're also
            secretly getting better at programming! It's a cool way to level up your skills without even realizing it.
            Dive into Guess the Color Code, enjoy the game, and watch your programming prowess grow! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»</p>
        <h2>Who made this website?</h2>
        <p>The website was created by Mohammad, an IT student who wanted to share his passion for games and
            programming with the world. We hope you will enjoy playing our games and learning more about programming at
            the same time.</p>
